# Tele-HealthCare
Developed a Java Swing Application to provide a better healthcare solution by decreasing the cost of the organization, while maintaining and providing an improved and end – to – end healthcare platform. The application implemented the concept of Internet of Things, where it leveraged the data provided by the by remote monitoring devices like Pressure Transducers, installed in the homes of post-operative and elderly patients to continuously monitor the vital signs and alert the nearest clinic in case of any abnormal activity. Integrated the application with Skype, so that the doctor can interact with the patients directly and get an online diagnosis if possible. The prescription can be directly sent to the patient via email, along with barcodes to provide proper authentication.
